** Problem Statement **
-----------------------

Instagram is a photo and video sharing app. People can upload photos or videos to the service and share them with their followers or with a select group of friends.
They can also view, comment and like posts shared by their friends on Instagram.

If you do not know what Instagram is, you should try to create an account and upload some photos there.
